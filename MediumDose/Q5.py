After 1,499 days on Mars, NASA's Perseverance Rover met two aliens named Muchiko and Sanchiko. They were very friendly and helpful throughout the exploration. As a gesture of friendship, NASA decided to send a gift on the next mission on April 4th â€” and they chose our Rover, Brick! ðŸŽ‰
So, We (MaRSians) had the lucky chance to talk with the Martian People. During our chat with Muchiko, we learned that Martians use a four-number system to represent 3D rotations, unlike our three-number system. Their system is better because it avoids Gimbal lock.
To help Brick fit in, we need to create a conversion code that will translate our system into theirs.
Can you write it before the launch?.
